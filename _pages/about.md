# üí¨ About me
I received my Bachelor's degree of Engineering with the School of Remote Sensing and Information, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China in 2022. In my Bachelor's degree, I worked in remote sensing, image processing, computer vision, and geographical information system. I am currently persuing my dual Master's degrees of Science in ESPACE (sepcialized in Navigation) with the State Key Laboratory of Information Engineering in Surveying, Mapping, and Remote Sensing, Wuhan University, Wuhan, China, and the Department of Aerospace and Geodesy, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. Currenty, my research interests include navigation and positioning, sensor fusion, SLAM and machine learning. 

E-mail: yanghaoxiao@whu.edu.cn && haoxiao.yang@tum.de

My research interests include:
- Sensor fusion (LiDAR, GNSS, IMU, Camera, 5G, Wi-Fi...)
- Navigation and positioning
- Simultaneous localization and mapping
- Autonomous Vehicle
- Machine learning
