# 💬 About me
I am a Computer Vision and SLAM researcher transitioning into the industry as an Algorithm Engineer in Perception at Jingwei Hirain Technologies Co., Inc. (Tier 1 autonomous vehicles company in China).

I recently graduated with dual Master’s degrees from Wuhan University and Technical University of Munich, where my research centered on navigation, localiztion, sensor fusion, aerial robotics and perception. My background stems from a Bachelor's degree in Remote Sensing, giving me a unique perspective on spatial information processing.

Currently, my professional focus lies in developing robust perception systems for autonomous vehicles, leveraging techniques in artifical intelligence and sensor fusion.
